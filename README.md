## Technologies

This project is built using the following technologies:

1) [aiogram](https://aiogram.dev/) - The library for working with Telegram API
2) [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) - A lightweight and self-contained SQL database engine.
3) [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) - A fast Python linter and formatter.
4) [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) - Tools for containerizing and deploying the bot in an isolated environment.

## Other
The bot was developed using [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a primary code editor. 

The `.vscode` folder was preserved in the repo. In the folder one can find the basic settings to run the code, and some setup for quick formatting and linting. (WARNING: `tasks.json` will work only on Windows, for Linux minor changes are required).
